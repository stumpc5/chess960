# Opening Analysis for Chess960

## Objective

Identify optimal openings.

We analyze about **20 million Chess960 matches** generated with **Stockfish 16**, more than **20.000 matches for each starting position**.
We then give a formal definition of an opening and apply it to the dataset.

This approach allows us to rediscovered traditional chess openings, and to identified novel openings across various Chess960 variants.

Consult the [project description](project_description.md) for details.
