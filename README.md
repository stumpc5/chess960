# Opening Analysis for Chess960

## Objective

Identify optimal openings.

* We analyze about **20 million Chess960 matches** generated with **Stockfish 16**.

* We give a formal definition of an opening and apply it to the dataset.

* This let us rediscover traditional chess openings, and identify novel openings across various Chess960 variants.

Consult the [project description](project_description.md) for details.
