# Data from Chess960 Win by Position Setup

Here, we present the data from [chess960-win-by-position-setup](https://github.com/welyab/chess960-win-by-position-setup/).
We sorted the 960 boards, and replace absolute numbers by percentages.

For better comparison, we finish every board analysis with the number of points for white.

We provide the same list twice, first sorted by [board name](#sorted-by-board-name), and then sorted by [advantage for white](#sorted-by-advantage-for-white).
